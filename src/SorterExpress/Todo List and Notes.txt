Todo
	It is possible that an image or video won't able to be read for some various reasons (already open, corrupted). Need to account for this using try/catch statements.
	Account for the possibility of 0 files or 0 folders.
	Opening file dialog at the desired location using pref last_used_directory just isnt working.
	Seems like there is a problem when doing an undo then saving the image again the fileindex appears to 'go backwards 1'.
	Mute button is kind of glitched, muting and setting the volume trackbar to 0 fires the event and sets unmuted volume to 0.

Maybe
	

Done
	Add ability to rename a tag in all given files.
	Add video functionality to duplicate finder.
		Mute buttons not yet working.
		VlcControls are not stretching to fit the media like the sort form does?
	Make it so that changing similarity percentage and searching again doesnt regenerate all file prints unless necessary.
