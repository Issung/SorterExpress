Todo
	General:
		Mute button is kind of glitched, muting and setting the volume trackbar to 0 fires the event and sets unmuted volume to 0.
		It is possible that an image or video won't able to be read for some various reasons (already open, corrupted). Need to account for this using try/catch statements.
		Account for the possibility of 0 files or 0 folders.
		Placeholder text available in .NET 5, use it everywhere!
		Use some damn FFMPEG/FFPROBE wrapper to get video data instead of starting applications and all that messy stuff.

	Sorter:
		Undo/Redo window (e.g. Photoshop).
		Add right click context menu to subfolder buttons, with options to bring up modify window, open destination folder, and remove.
		When opening new current file check if it exists, if not, remove it from list and update index accordingly, continue on.

	Viewer:
		Stop images grid horizontal scroll bar appearing.

	Rename Tag:
		Update constructor to take an argument and open a folder instantly.

	Duplicate Finder:
		Add more options?
			Keep largest?
			Keep file with most tags?

	MediaViewer
		Now using while loops to wait for the VlcControl to load/unload it's media.
			It fixes issues of loading/unloading media too many times too rapidly. But:
			Potentially bad, could cause infinite loops if the media can't be loaded?
			Use a multi-threaded approach?
			Post the MediaViewer control on the vlc library github?


Done
	Removed "search subfolders" and "only match between immediate and subdirectories" and created a new ComboBox with both of these options and a new option
	to only search subdirectories and not the immediate directory.
	Wrapped duplicate search filters in a group box.

	Made matches grid view columns non-resizable and made similarity column fill remaining width instead of taking up too much space.
	Option to only compare images to images and videos to videos (stop comparing images to videos and vice versa).
	Option to only search for duplicates between current directory and subdirectories instead of searching for duplicates between subdirectories

	Added right click context menu to duplicates form matches list.
		Allows for selection of keeping right/left, neither or both (skip).
		Does not require the user to view that match.
		Gets added to undo stack and is undoable.
		Required small rework of controller methods to take option index parameter.
		KeepSide and DeleteBothSides now check if the duplicate is being viewed before unloading media.
		Fixed glitch of MergeTags and DuplicatesOnlyKeepTagsInLibrary not being saved on duplicates form exit.

	MVC Rewrite of DuplicatesForm.
		Under & Redo added, with stacks. Working fine. (remove other duplicates with same file, take into account tag manipulation options, undo works too, etc).
		Databindings everywhere, all controls enable/disable and update fields as needed.
		FileCount label now displays the count of matches in the list also.
	New DuplicatesForm MassOperation function.
		Performs the same operation on all remaining duplicates.
		Supports order of preference, current options are deepest directory, highest resolution, and most tags.
		Adds actions to the undo stack.
		Databinds to the same fields as the parent form for the tag manipulation options.

	Added search box to subfolder list, hides, shows and orders the buttons via the input filter. ENTER key selects the top one.
	Added setting to reset this search box on enter or not, like tag search box.

	Changed SortForm to entirely new MVC rewrite.
		Uses public properties and data bindings.
		New TagsPanel and SubfoldersPanel user controls to manage button controls.
		New keyboard shortcuts handling using dictionary (also program wide now).
		New action framework making undo and redo stacks available.
			New undelete file from recycle bin ability with undo.
		New "RBindingList" class extends bindinglist and has delete event to notify of deleted object and a reference to it.
	Add Directory form now loads chosen folder as default name if nothing already in text box.
	Lots of controls in SortForm now become enabled/disabled according to if they should be available thanks to data binding.
	New [ALT + Digit] shortcut to move current file to a subfolder in the list (1 for top to 0 for 10th entry).

	Duplicate Finder
		Fixed lots of issues with duplicate finder.
		Thumbnails are now an MD5 of the entire path (c:\temp\temp\filename.jpg) instead of just the filename (filename.jpg).
		Added cropping of borders in thumbnails.
	Settings Form
		Reworked settings form to use panel with docking and autoscroll.
		Added "view" button for thumbs location.
		Fixed view logs button.
		Added toggling of windows context menu options using registry.
	MediaViewer
		Moved finding vlc to Load event, works better with designer.

	Added mass-tag argument to automatically open that window.
	Changed design of duplicate list in duplicate finder, addeing image previews, using databinding.
	Hash images and save small thumbs like with video thumbs done.

	Highlighting tags in bold that are not on the other file in the duplicate finder is fixed.
	Add more options to duplicate finder:
		Merge tags to selected copy.

	Add ability to rename a tag in all given files.
	Add video functionality to duplicate finder.
		Mute buttons not yet working.
		VlcControls are not stretching to fit the media like the sort form does?
	Make it so that changing similarity percentage and searching again doesnt regenerate all file prints unless necessary.
